Arson is a gateway between 37signals' Campfire (
http://campfirenow.com/ ) and your own Jabber server, where campfire
rooms appear as MUC (multi-user chat) rooms.

Optionally, you can then use bitlbee and an IRC client to get all
your campfire in your IRC client.

Various bits of this were taken from various tutorials around the
web, but no more than a line or two from any of them has been left
untouched, so everything in here is Public Domain.

Arson will almost certainly be updated exactly enough to meet my
needs, and no further; feel free to send a pull request if you want
to add a feature.

Arson is written in Ruby.

          Requirements
          ------------

Gems
----


Other
-----

To follow the instructions below to the letter, you will need an
ejabberd instance on localhost.  Otherwise, configuring the campfire
component on your jabber server is up to you.

          Instructions
          ------------

Basic Setup
-----------

Get the code with:

  git clone git://github.com/rlpowell/arson.git

Copy ExampleArsonConfig.rb to ArsonConfig.rb and modify
ArsonConfig.rb to your liking; there are instructions in the
comments there.  It's Ruby code, so be mindful of the syntax.

Normally, though, you should only have to change the
JabberComponentSecret, the list of user config files, and the
LogFile.

Per-User Setup
--------------

In ArsonConfig.rb is the Configs array, which is a list of file
names.  Each of those files is taken as the configuration file for an
arson user.  The server needs to be run such that it can read those
files.  Configuration is only loaded on startup.

The files are YAML, and fairly straightforward; see example_arsonrc
for details.  Copy it to ~/.arsonrc (or wherever) and change it as
you like.

ejabberd Setup
--------------

Install ejabberd on the host you'll be running arson on.

Make an account for you on ejabberd like so:

  sudo ejabberdctl register USERNAME localhost PASSWORD

Add the following to your ejabberd.cfg, in the same place as the
example ejabberd_service that should already be there (in the
"listen" section):

- ------------------------------------

  {5347, ejabberd_service, [
                            {access, all},
                            {hosts, ["campfire.localhost"],
                                    [{password, "[COMPONENT PASSWORD]"}]
                            }
                            ]},

- ------------------------------------

Also make sure the lists of "hosts" includes "localhost".

Then restart the server ("sudo ejabberdctl restart", probably).

Execution
---------

It uses the Daemon gem, so it pretends to act like a normal UNIX
daemon.

Running "ruby arson.rb" will give you the execution options.

Start with:     ruby arson.rb start
Stop  with:     ruby arson.rb stop


          bitlbee/IRC Instructions
          ------------------------

You can use arson to get access to campfire in your IRC client by
using http://www.bitlbee.org/ , which is what I wrote it for in the
first place.

Old bitlbee (1.2.3 or so)
-------------------------

Create the account in bitlbee:

  account add jabber USERNAME@localhost PASSWORD

Start it up:

  account list
  account [account number] on

Join each room; this uses the jabber room name from the config file:

  join_chat [account number] [jabber room name]@conference.localhost

New bitlbee (3.0 or so)
-----------------------

bitlbee 3.0 is better because it doesn't screw up the capitalization.

Create the account in bitlbee:

  account add jabber USERNAME@localhost PASSWORD

Start it up:

  account 0 on

Join each room; this uses the jabber room name from the config file:

  chat add 0 Testing@campfire.localhost


          Acknowledgements & Legal
          ------------------------

This project wouldn't exist without the help of my friend Stephen
Weeks ( http://allalone.org/ ), who suggested the component solution
and explain how XMPP (aka Jabber) works to me.

I've used examples and code snippets from various places around the
web in making arson; not counting the various XEPs and RFCs, here's
an incomplete list:

Having said that, none of the code I copied survives, and all the
arson code is licensed as show below.  I would appreciate
attribution, however.
