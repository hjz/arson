Arson is a gateway between 37signals' Campfire (
http://campfirenow.com/ ) and your own Jabber server, where campfire
rooms appear as MUC (multi-user chat) rooms.

Optionally, you can then use bitlbee and an IRC client to get all
your campfire in your IRC client.

Various bits of this were taken from various tutorials around the
web, but no more than a line or two from any of them has been left
untouched, so everything in here is Public Domain.

Arson will almost certainly be updated exactly enough to meet my
needs, and no further; feel free to send a pull request if you want
to add a feature.

Arson is written in Ruby.

          Requirements
          ------------

Gems
----


Other
-----

To follow the instructions below to the letter, you will need an
ejabberd instance on localhost.  Otherwise, configuring the campfire
component on your jabber server is up to you.

          Instructions
          ------------

Basic Setup
-----------

Stick arson.rb and ArsonConfig.rb in a directory somewhere.

Modify ArsonConfig.rb to your liking; there are instructions in the
comments there.  It's Ruby code, so be mindful of the syntax.
FIXME: Config Instructions here?

ejabberd Setup
--------------

Install ejabberd on the host you'll be running arson on.

Add the following to your ejabberd.cfg, in the same place as the
example ejabberd_service that should already be there (in the
"listen" section):

- ------------------------------------

  {5347, ejabberd_service, [
                            {access, all},
                            {hosts, ["campfire.localhost"],
                                    [{password, "campfirepass"}]
                            }
                            ]},

- ------------------------------------

Also make sure the lists of "hosts" includes "localhost".

Then restart the server ("sudo ejabberdctl restart", probably).

Execution
---------

It uses the Daemon gem, so it pretends to act like a normal UNIX
daemon.

Running "ruby arson.rb" will give you the execution options.

Start with:     ruby arson.rb start
Stop  with:     ruby arson.rb stop


          bitlbee/IRC Instructions
          ------------------------

Get bitlbee installed and running.  Make an account for you on
ejabberd like so:

  sudo ejabberdctl register USERNAME localhost PASSWORD

Old bitlbee (1.2.3 or so)
-------------------------

Create the account in bitlbee:

  account add jabber USERNAME@localhost PASSWORD

Start it up:

  account list
  account [account number] on

Join each room; this uses the jabber room name from the config file:

  join_chat [account number] [jabber room name]@conference.localhost

New bitlbee FIXmE: ???
-------------------------
